## Folder contents : 
### 1) extract_responsibility : This script contains the code for extracting the useful sentences and filtering out the non required ones. Use of NLTK for POS tagging and chunking is done here further the skill dictionary made by version_2.py from preproccessing folder is used to remove the sentences containing skill words.
### 2) top_responsibility : This code is for the purpose of extracting top responsibility for a particular job posting. If we have 200 job descriptions and we need to find the sentences which explains most of the posted responsibility then we can use the cosine distance or word mover's approach to find the sentences which are similar and then based upon cosine distance metric we can take the sentence which explains the meaning of most of the sentences as top responsibility.
### 3) top_responsibiltiy : This script contains the code for making clusters of alike sentences , the business problem required us to find the top 5 responsiblity hence by clustering the alike sentences together and clubbing the top three sentences in a cluster we get the top 5 responsibilities which cover all the posted sentences containing the required job activity.
